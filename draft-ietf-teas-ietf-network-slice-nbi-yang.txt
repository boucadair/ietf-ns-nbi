1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG [RFC7950] data model for the IETF
   Network Slice Service as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

   This YANG module can be used in the IETF Network Slice Service
   Interface exposed by a provider to its customers in order to manage
   (e.g., subscribe, delete, or change) IETF Network Slice Services.
   The agreed service will then trigger appropriate IETF Network Slice
   operation, such as instantiating, modifying, or deleting an IETF
   Network Slice.

   As discussed in [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], the mapping
   between an IETF Network Slice Service and its realization is
   implementation and deployment specific.

   The IETF Network Slice Service YANG model focuses on the requirements
   of an IETF Network Slice Service from the point of view of the
   customer, not how it is implemented by a provider.  The module is
   classified as customer service model (Section 2 of [RFC8309]).

   The IETF Network Slice Service YANG model conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture [RFC8342].

   Editorial Note: (To be removed by RFC Editor)

   This draft contains several placeholder values that need to be
   replaced with finalized values at the time of publication.  Please
   apply the following replacements:

   *  "XXXX" --> the assigned RFC value for this draft both in this
      draft and in the YANG models under the revision statement.

   *  The "revision" date in model, in the format XXXX-XX-XX, needs to
      be updated with the date the draft gets approved.

3.  IETF Network Slice Service Overview

   As defined in Section 3.2 of [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], an
   IETF Network Slice Service is specified in terms of a set of SDPs, a
   set of one or more connectivity constructs between subsets of these
   SDPs, and a set of SLOs and SLEs for each SDP sending to each
   connectivity construct.  A communication type (point- to-point (P2P),
   point-to-multipoint (P2MP), or any-to-any (A2A)) is specified for
   each connectivity construct.

   The SDPs serve as the IETF Network Slice ingress/egress points.  An
   SDP is identified by a unique identifier in the context of an IETF
   Network Slice Service.

   Examples of IETF Network Slice Services that contain each only one
   connectivity construct are shown in Figure 1.

             Figure 2: Examples of IETF Network Slice Services

   As shown in Figure 2, the IETF Network Slice Service 4 contains two
   P2P connectivity constructs between the set of SDPs.  The IETF
   network slice service 5 is a bidirectional unicast service between
   SDP14 and SDP15 that consists of two unidirectional P2P connectivity
   constructs.

4.  IETF Network Slice Service Model Usage

   The NSSM can be used by a provider to expose its Slice Service, and
   by a customer to manage its IETF Network Slices Services (e.g.,
   request, delete, or change).  The details about how service requests
   are handled by the provider, including which network operations are
   triggered, are internal to the provider.  The details of the IETF
   Network Slices realization are hidden from customers.

   The IETF Network Slices are applicable to use cases, such as (but not
   limited to) network wholesale services, network infrastructure
   sharing among operators, NFV (Network Function Virtualization)
   connectivity, Data Center Interconnect, and 5G E2E network slice.

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model          March 2023


   The IETF Network Slice Controller (NSC) is an entity that exposes the
   IETF Network Slice Service Interface to customers to manage IETF
   Network Slice Services.  Typically, the NSC receives requests from
   its customer-facing interface (e.g., from a management system).
   During service creation, this interface can carry data objects the
   IETF Network Slice service customer provides, describing the needed
   IETF network slices service in terms of a set of SDPs, the associated
   connectivity constructs and the service objectives that the customer
   wishes to be fulfilled.  These service requirements are then
   translated into technology-specific actions that are implemented in
   the underlying network using a network-facing interface.  The details
   of how the IETF Network Slices are put into effect are out of scope
   for this document.

   As shown in Figure 3, in all the use cases, the model is used by the
   customer's higher level operation system to communicate with the NSC
   for life cycle management of IETF Network Slices including both
   enablement and monitoring.  For example, in the 5G E2E (End-to-end)
   network slicing use-case the E2E network slice orchestrator acts as
   the higher layer system to request the IETF Network Slices.  The
   interface is used to support dynamic IETF Network Slice creation and
   its lifecycle management to facilitate end-to-end network slice
   services.

        Figure 3: IETF Network Slice Service Reference Architecture

   Note: The model can be recursive (hierarchical mode), i.e. an NSSM
   can map a child NSSM.  As described in Section 5.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], the IETF Network Slice can
   support a recursive composite architecture that allows one layer of
   IETF network slices to be used by other layers.

5.  IETF Network Slice Service Modeling Description

   The 'ietf-network-slice-service' module includes two main data nodes:
   'slice-service' and 'slo-sle-templates' (see Figure 4).

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model          March 2023


   The 'slice-service' list includes the set of IETF Network Slice
   Services that are maintained by a provider. 'slice-service' is the
   data structure that abstracts the IETF Network Slice Service.  Under
   the 'slice-service', the 'sdp' list is used to abstract the SDPs.
   The 'connection-group' is used to abstract connectivity constructs
   between SDPs.

   The 'slo-sle-templates' container is used by an NSC to maintain a set
   of common network slice SLO and SLE templates that apply to one or
   several IETF Network Slice Services.

   The tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined
   in [RFC8340].

   The figure below describes the overall structure of the YANG module:

   module: ietf-network-slice-service
     +--rw network-slice-services
        +--rw slo-sle-templates
        |  +--rw slo-sle-template* [id]

        +--rw slice-service* [id]
           +--rw id                              string

           +--rw (slo-sle-policy)?
           |     ...

5.1.  IETF Network Slice Service SLO and SLE Templates

   The 'slo-sle-templates' container (Figure 4) is used by the service
   provider of the NSC to define and maintain a set of common IETF
   Network Slice templates that apply to one or several IETF Network
   Slice services.  The exact definition of the templates is deployment
   specific to each network provider.

   The model includes the identifiers of SLO and SLE templates and the

   Considering that there are many attributes defined and some
   attributes could vary with service requirements, e.g., bandwidth, or
   latency, multiple standard templates as well as custom "service-slo-
   sle-policy" are defined:

   1:  Standard template with no attribute specified: The exact
       definition of the templates is deployment specific to the
       provider.

   2:  Standard template with attributes specified: Provides the
       customers with the ability to define templates, or reference a
       predefined template "template-ref" and override specific
       attributes, and apply them to NS service configuration.

   3:  Custom "service-slo-sle-policy": More description is provided in
       Section 5.2.3.

   The following shows an example where two network slice templates can
   be retrieved by the customers:

5.2.  IETF Network Slice Services

   The 'slice-service' is the data structure that abstracts an IETF
   Network Slice Service.  Each 'slice-service' is uniquely identified
   by an identifier: 'service-id' in the context of an NSC.

   An IETF Network Slice service has the following main parameters:

   *  "id": Is an identifier that is used to uniquely identify the IETF
      Network Slice service within an NSC.

   *  "description": Gives some description of an IETF Network Slice
      service.

   *  "status": Is used to show the operative and administrative status
      of the IETF Network Slice service, and can be used as indicator to
      detect network slice anomalies.

   *  "service-tags": Indicates a management tag (e.g.  "customer-name"
      ) that is used to correlate the operational information of
      "Customer higher level operation system" and IETF network slices.
      It might be used by IETF Network Slice Service operator to provide
      additional information to the NSC during the automation of the
      IETF network slices.  E.g.  adding tags with "customer-name" when
      multiple actual customers use a same network slice service.
      Another use-case for "service-tag" might be for an operator to
      provide additional attributes to NSC which might be used during
      the realization of IETF Network Slice services such as type of
      services (e.g., L2 or L3).  These additional attributes can also
      be used by the NSC for various use-cases such as monitoring and
      assurance of the IETF Network Slice services where NSC can notify
      the customer system by issuing the notifications.  Note that all
      these attributes are OPTIONAL but might be useful for some use-
      cases.

   *  "slo-sle-policy": Defines SLO and SLE policies for the "slice-
      service".  More details are provided in Section 5.2.3.

   *  "sdp": Represents a set of SDPs that are involved in the IETF
      Network Slice Service with each 'sdp' belonging to a single
      'slice-service'.  More details are provided inSection 5.2.1.

   *  "connection-groups": Abstracts the connections to the set of SDPs
      of the IETF Network Slice service.

5.2.1.  IETF Network Slice Service Demarcation Points

   An SDP belong to a single IETF Network Slice service.  An IETF
   Network Slice service involves two or more SDPs.  An IETF Network
   Slice service can be modified by adding new "sdp" or removing
   existing "sdp".

   Section 5.2 of [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] describes four
   possible ways in which the SDP may be placed:

   *  Within CE

   *  Provider-facing ports on the CE

   *  Customer-facing ports on the PE

   *  Within PE

   Although there are four options, they can be categorized into two:
   CE-based or PE-based.  To simplify the model, the NSC and the
   customer's system can agree on the choice of these two types without
   marking the type on each SDP.




Wu, et al.              Expires 10 September 2023              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model          March 2023


   In the four options, the Attachment Circuit (AC) may be part of the
   IETF Network Slice service or may be external to it.  Based on the
   definition of AC in Section 3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], the customer and provider may
   agree on a per {IETF Network Slice service, connectivity construct,
   and SLOs/SLEs} basis to police or shape traffic on the AC in both the
   ingress (CE to PE) direction and egress (PE to CE) direction, which
   ensures that the traffic is within the capacity profile that is
   agreed in an IETF Network Slice service.  Excess traffic is dropped
   by default, unless specific out-of-profile policies are agreed
   between the customer and the provider.

   To abstract the SDP options and SLOs/SLEs profiles, an SDP has
   several characteristics:

   *  "id": Uniquely identifies the SDP within the Network Slice
      Controller (NSC).  The identifier is a string that allows any
      encoding for the local administration of the IETF Network Slice
      service.

   *  "location": Indicates SDP location information, which helps the
      NSC to identify an SDP.

   *  "node-id": A reference to the node that hosts the SDP, which helps
      the NSC to identify an SDP.

   *  "sdp-ip": The SDP IP information, which helps the NSC to identify
      an SDP.

   *  "incoming-qos-policy" and "outgoing-qos-policy": Sets the incoming
      and outgoing QoS policies to apply on a given SDP, including QoS
      policy and specific ingress and egress traffic limits to ensure
      access security.  When applied in the incoming direction, the
      rate-limit is applicable to the traffic from the SDP to the IETF
      scope Network that passes through the AC.  When Bandwidth is
      applied to the outgoing direction, it is applied to the traffic
      from the IETF Network to the SDP of that particular slice service.
      If an SDP has multiple ACs, the "rate-limits" of "attachment-
      circuit" can be set to an AC specific value, but the rate cannot
      exceed the "rate-limits" of the SDP.  If an SDP only contains a
      single AC, then the "rate-limits" of "attachment-circuit" is the
      same with the SDP.  The definition of AC refers to Section 3.1
      [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

   *  "ac-svc-name": Indicates an attachment circuit service name, for
      association purposes, to refer to an AC that has been created when
      an AC is used by multiple slices.

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model          March 2023


   *  "attachment-circuit": Specifies the list of ACs by which the
      service traffic is received.  This is an optional SDP attribute.
      When an SDP has multiple ACs and the AC specific attributes is
      needed, each "attachment-circuit" can specify attributes such as
      interface specific IP addresses, service MTU, etc.

   *  "sdp-peering": Specifies the protocol for an SDP for exchanging
      control-plane information, e.g.  L1 signaling protocol or L3
      routing protocols, etc.

      -  "peer-sap-id": Indicates a reference to the remote endpoints of
         an attachment circuit.A unique identifier that identifies a
         given Service Attachment Point (SAP) defined in
         [I-D.ietf-opsawg-sap], which defines a model of an abstract
         view of the provider network topology that contains the points
         from which its services can be attached.

      -  "protocols": Serves as an augmentation target.  Appendix A The
         example protocols of an SDP can be BGP, static routing, etc.

   *  "status": Enables the control of the operative and administrative
      status of the SDP, can be used as indicator to detect SDP
      anomalies.

   *  "service-match-criteria": Defines matching policies for network
      slice service traffic to apply on a given SDP.

   Depending on the requirements of different cases, “service-match-
   criteria” can be used for the following purposes:

   *  Specify the AC type: physical or logical connection

   *  Distinguish the SDP traffic if the SDP is located in the CE or PE

   *  Distinguish the traffic of different CGs or CCs when multiple CGs/
      CCs of different SLO/SLE may be set up between a same pair of
      SDPs, as illustrated in Figure 5.  Traffic needs to be explicitly
      mapped into the IETF Network Slice's specific connectivity
      construct.  The policies, "service-match-criteria", are based on
      the values in which combination of layer 2 and layer 3 header and
      payload fields within a packet to identify to which {IETF Network
      Slice service, connectivity construct, and SLOs/SLEs} that packet
      is assigned.

   *  Define specific out-of-profile policies: The customer may choose
      to use an explicit "service-match-criteria" to map all the SDP's
      traffic or a subset of the SDP's traffic to a specific connection-
      group or connectivity-construct. if a subset of traffic is matched

      (ie. dscp-match) and mapped to a connectivity-construct, the
      customer may choose to add a subsequent "match-any" to explicitly
      map the remaining SDP traffic to a separate connectivity-
      construct.  If the customer chooses to implicitly map remaining
      traffic and if there is no additional connectivity constructs
      where the "sdp-id" source is specified, then that traffic will be
      dropped.

                  Figure 5: Application of Match Criteria

   If an SDP is placed at the port or AC of a CE or PE, and there is
   only one single connectivity construct with a source at the SDP,
   traffic can be implicitly mapped to this connectivity construct since
   the port or AC can be used to identify the traffic and the SDP is the
   only source of the connectivity-construct.  Appendix B.1 shows an
   example of both the implicit and explicit approaches.

   While explicit matching is optional in some use cases, it provides a
   more clear and readable implementation, but the choice is left to the
   operator.

   To illustrate the use of SDP options, the below are two examples.
   How the NSC realize the mapping is out of scope for this document.

*  SDPs at customer-facing ports on the PEs: As shown in Figure 6 ,
   customer of the IETF network slice service would like to connect
   two SDPs to satisfy specific service, e.g., Network wholesale
   services.  In this case, the IETF network slice SDPs are mapped to
   customer-facing ports of PE nodes.  The NSC uses 'node-id' (PE
   device ID), 'attachment-circuit' (ACs) to map SDPs to the
   customer-facing ports on the PEs.

5.2.2.  IETF Network Slice Service Connectivity Constructs

   Based on the customer's service traffic requirements, an IETF Network
   Slice service connectivity type could be point-to-point (P2P), point-
   to-multipoint (P2MP), any-to-any (A2A) or a combination of these
   types.

   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] defines the basic connectivity
   construct for a network slice, and the connectivity construct may
   have different SLO and SLE requirements.  "connectivity-construct"
   represents this connectivity construct, and "slo-sle-policy" under it
   represents the per-connectivity construct SLO and SLE requirements.

   Apart from the per-connectivity construct SLO and SLE, slice service
   traffic is usually managed by combining similar types of traffic.
   For example, some connections for video services require high
   bandwidth, and some connections for voice over IP request low latency
   and reliability.

   "connection-group" is thus defined to treat each type as a class with
   per-connection-group SLO and SLE such that the connectivity construct
   can inherit the SLO/SLE from the group if not explicitly defined.
   Additionally, in the case of Hub&Spoke connectivity, it may be
   inefficient when the are large number of SDP with the multiple CCs.
   As illustrated in Appendix B.3, "connectivity-type" of "vpn-
   common:hub-spoke" and "connection-group-sdp-role" of "vpn-common:hub-
   role" or "vpn-common:spoke-role" can be specified.

5.2.3.  IETF Network Slice Service SLO and SLE Policy

   As defined in section 4 [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], the SLO
   and SLE policy of an IETF Network Slice service defines some common
   attributes.

   "slo-sle-policy" is used to represent specific SLO and SLE policies.
   During the creation of an IETF Network Slice service, the policy can
   be specified either by a standard SLO and SLO template or a
   customized SLO and SLE policy.

   The policy can apply to per-network slice service, per-connection
   group "connection group", or per-connectivity construct
   "connectivity-construct".  Since there are multiple mechanisms for
   assigning a policy to a single connectivity construct, an overridden
   precedence order among them is as follows:

   *  Connectivity-construct at an individual sending SDP

   *  Connectivity-construct

   *  Connection-group

   *  Slice-level

   That is, the policy assigned through the sending SDP has highest
   precedence, and the policy assigned by the slice level has lowest
   precedence.  Therefore, the policy assigned through the sending SDP
   takes precedence over the policy assigned through the connection-
   construct entry.  Appendix B.5 gives an example of the preceding
   policy, which shows a slice service having an any-to-any connectivity
   as default and several specific SLO connections.

   The container "metric-bounds" supports all the variations and
   combinations of SLOs, which includes a list of "metric-bound" and
   each "metric-bound" could specify a particular "metric-type".
   "metric-type" is defined with YANG identity and supports the
   following options:

      "service-slo-one-way-bandwidth": Indicates the guaranteed minimum
      bandwidth between any two SDPs.  And the bandwidth is
      unidirectional.

      "service-slo-two-way-bandwidth": Indicates the guaranteed minimum
      bandwidth between any two SDPs.  And the bandwidth is
      bidirectional.

      "service-slo-one-way-delay-maximum": Indicates the maximum one-way

      latency between two SDPs.

      "service-slo-two-way-delay-maximum": Indicates the maximum round-
      trip latency between two SDPs.

      "service-slo-one-way-delay-percentile": Indicates the percentile
      objective of the one-way latency between two SDPs.

      "service-slo-two-way-delay-percentile": Indicates the percentile
      objective of the round-trip latency between two SDPs.

      "service-slo-one-way-delay-variation-maximum": Indicates the
      jitter constraint of the slice maximum permissible delay
      variation, and is measured by the difference in the one-way
      latency between sequential packets in a flow.

      "service-slo-two-way-delay-variation-maximum": Indicates the
      jitter constraint of the slice maximum permissible delay
      variation, and is measured by the difference in the two-way
      latency between sequential packets in a flow.

      "service-slo-one-way-delay-variation-percentile": Indicates the
      percentile objective of the delay variation, and is measured by
      the difference in the one-way latency between sequential packets
      in a flow.

      "service-slo-two-way-delay-variation-percentile": Indicates the
      percentile objective of the delay variation, and is measured by
      the difference in the two-way latency between sequential packets
      in a flow.

      "service-slo-one-way-packet-loss": Indicates maximum permissible
      packet loss rate, which is defined by the ratio of packets dropped
      to packets transmitted between two SDPs.

      "service-slo-two-way-packet-loss": Indicates maximum permissible
      packet loss rate, which is defined by the ratio of packets dropped
      to packets transmitted between two SDPs.

      "service-slo-availability": Is defined as the ratio of up-time to
      total_time(up-time+down-time), where up-time is the time the IETF
      Network Slice is available in accordance with the SLOs associated
      with it.

   The following common SLEs are defined:

      "mtu": Refers to the service MTU, which is the maximum PDU size
      that the customer may use.



Wu, et al.              Expires 10 September 2023              [Page 21]

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model          March 2023


      "security": The security leaf-list defines the list of security
      techniques to traffic flowing between the two SDPs, including
      authentication, encryption, etc.

      "isolation": Specifies the isolation level that a customer
      expects, including dedicated, shared, or other level.

      "max-occupancy-level": Specifies the number of flows to be
      admitted and optionally a maximum number of countable resource
      units (e.g., IP or MAC addresses) an IETF Network Slice Service
      can consume.

      "steering-constraints": Specifies the constraints how the provider
      routes traffic for the IETF Network Slice Service.

   The following shows an example where a network slice policy can be
   configured:

   {
     "slice-services": {
       "slice-service": {
         "id": "exp-slice",
         "service-slo-sle-policy": {
           "description": "video-service-policy",
           "metric-bounds": {
             "metric-bound": [
               {
                 "metric-type": "service-slo-one-way-bandwidth",
                 "metric-unit": "mbps",
                 "bound": "1000"
               },
               {
                 "metric-type": "service-slo-availability",
                 "bound": "99.9%"
               }
             ]
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }

   For a multiple connectivity-construct slice service, when a
   connection-group or a connectivity-construct has some specific
   requirements, such as bandwidth or latency, that are different from
   those defined of the slice-service, the new set of SLO&SLE with full
   or partial override can be applied.  "service-slo-sle-policy-
   override" is used to specify the requirements.

5.2.4.  IETF Network Slice Service Monitoring

   An IETF Network Slice service defines connectivity with specific SLO
   characteristics, including bandwidth, latency, etc.  The connectivity
   is a combination of logical unidirectional connections, represented
   by 'connectivity-construct'.

   This model also describes operational and performance status of an
   IETF Network Slice.  The statistics are described in the following
   granularity:

   *  Per SDP: specified in 'sdp-monitoring' under the "sdp".

   *  Per connectivity construct: specified in 'connectivity-construct-
      monitoring' under the "connectivity-construct".

   *  Per connection group: specified in 'connection-group-monitoring'
      under the "connection-group".

   This model does not define monitoring enabling methods.  The
   mechanism defined in [RFC8640] and [RFC8641] can be used for either
   periodic or on-demand subscription.

   By specifying subtree filters or xpath filters to "sdp",
   "connectivity-construct", or "connection-group", so that only
   interested contents will be sent.  These mechanisms can be used for
   monitoring the IETF Network Slice performance status so that the
   customer management system could initiate modification based on the
   IETF Network Slice running status.

5.2.5.  IETF Network Slice Service on Custom Topology

   The IETF Network Slice customer might ask for some level of control
   of, e.g., to customize the service paths in a network slice.

   Section 3.13 in [RFC8345] defines abstract topology concept to
   accommodate both the provider's resource capability and the
   customer's preferences.  The abstract topology is a topology that
   contains abstract topological elements (nodes, links, termination
   points).  The following nodes are the extensions for this use case

      "custom-topology-ref": The container under the list "slice-
      service" is defined to reference the prebuilt topology as a
      customized topology constraint for a slice service.

      "tp-ref": A reference to Termination Point (TP) in the custom

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model          March 2023


      topology, under the list "sdp", is used to associate an SDP with
      the customized topology to create point-to-point abstract links.
      These abstract links can be used as the underlying links of the
      connectivity-construct when a NS service is created.

   The model can be extended if some implementations require path
   control with specific constraints.

5.2.6.  IETF Network Slice Service Compute

   An NS is, by default, provisioned so that it can instantiated and
   deliver the service.  The IETF Network Slice customer may check the
   feasibility before instantiating a Network Slice Service.  In such a
   case, the NS is configured in 'compute-only' mode to distinguish it
   from the default behavior.

   A 'compute-only' NS is configured as usual with the associated per
   slice SLOs/SLEs.  The NSC computes the feasible CC to the configured
   SLOs/SLEs.  This computation does not create a NS or reserve any
   resources in the system, it simply computes the resulting NS based on
   information.  The Network Slice “administrative-status” and the CG or
   CC list are used to convey the result.  For example, "admin-pre-
   deployment" can be used to show the status.

7.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport
   layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure
   Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   o /ietf-network-slice-service/network-slice-services/slice-service

   The entries in the list above include the whole network
   configurations corresponding with the slice service which the higher
   management system requests, and indirectly create or modify the PE or
   P device configurations.  Unexpected changes to these entries could
   lead to service disruption and/or network misbehavior.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a URI in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688].
   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registration is
   requested to be made:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-network-slice-service
      Registrant Contact: The IESG.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document requests to register a YANG module in the YANG Module
   Names registry [RFC7950].

           Name: ietf-network-slice-service
           Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-network-slice-service
           Prefix: ietf-nss
           Reference: RFC XXXX

Appendix A.  Attachment Circuit Augmentation Considerations

   An AC is technology specific.  The customer and provider need to
   agree, through configuration, on the technology parameter values,
   such as the protocol types and protocol parameters between the PE and
   the CE.

   The following shows an example where BGP and static routing are
   augmented to the Network Slice Service model.

  augment /ietf-nss:network-slice-services/ietf-nss:slice-service/ietf-nss:sdps\
  /ietf-nss:sdp/ietf-nss:sdp-peering/ietf-nss:protocols:
    +--rw bgp-attributes
    |  +--rw description?   string
    |  +--rw peer-as?       inet:as-number
    |  +--rw neighbor*      inet:ip-address
    +--rw static-attributes
       +--rw cascaded-lan-prefixes
          +--rw ip-lan-prefixes* [lan next-hop]
             +--rw lan         inet:ip-prefix
             +--rw next-hop    union
                   ...

   In some scenarios, for example, when multiple slice services share
   one or more ACs, or ACs change frequently, independent AC services,

B.1.  Example-1: Two Any-to-any Slice Services with different match
      approachs

   The following example describes a simplified service configuration of
   two IETF Network slice instances where the SDPs are the customer-
   facing ports on the PE:

   *  IETF Network Slice 1 on SDP1, SDP11a, and SDP4, with any-to-any
      connectivity type.  This is a L3 slice service and using the
      uniform low-latency slo-sle-template policy between all SDPs.
      These SDPs will also have AC eBGP peering sessions with unmanaged
      CE elements.

   *  IETF Network Slice 2 on SDP2, SDP11b, with any-to-any connectivity
      type.  This is a L3 slice service and using the uniform high-BW
      slo-sle-template policy between all SDPs.  These SDPs will also
      have AC eBGP peering sessions with unmanaged CE elements.

   Slice 1 uses the explicit match approach for mapping SDP traffic to a
   connectivity-construct, while slice 2 uses the implicit approach.
   Both approaches are supported.

   Note: These two slices both use service-tags of "L3".  This service-
   tag is operator defined and has no specific meaning in the YANG model
   other to give a "hint" to the NSC on the Service Expectation being L3
   forwarding.  Other examples we may choose to eliminate it.  The usage
   of this tag is arbitrary and up to the operator and the NSC on it's
   need and usage.

B.2.  Example-2: Two P2P slice services with different match approaches

   The following example describes a simplified service configuration of
   two IETF Network slice instances where the SDPs are the customer-
   facing ports on the PE:

   *  IETF Network Slice 3 on SDP5 and SDP7a with pt-to-pt connectivity
      type.  This is a L2 slice service and using the uniform low-
      latency slo-sle-template policies between the SDPs.

   *  IETF Network Slice 4 on SDP6 and SDP7b, with pt-to-pt connectivity
      type.  This is a L2 slice service and using the a high-BW slo-sle-
      template policies between the SDPs.  Traffic from SDP6 and SDP7b
      is requesting a BW of 1000Mbps, while in the reverse direction
      from SDO7b to SDP6, 5000Mbps is being requested.

   Slice 3 uses the explicit match approach for mapping SDP traffic to a
   Connectivity-group, while slice 2 uses the implicit approach.  Both
   approaches are supported.

   Note: These two slices both use service-tags of "L2".  This service-
   tag is operator defined and has no specific meaning in the YANG model
   other to give a "hint" to the NSC on the Service Expectation being L2
   forwarding.  Other examples we may choose to eliminate it.  The usage
   of this tag is arbitrary and up to the operator and the NSC on it's
   need and usage.

B.3.  Example-3: A Hub-and-spoke Slice Service with a P2MP connectivity
      construct

   The following example describes a simplified service configuration of
   one IETF Network slice instance where the SDPs are the customer-
   facing ports on the PE:

      IETF Network Slice 5 is a hub-spoke slice with SDP14 as the hub
      and SDP11, SDP12, SDP13a, SDP13b as spokes.  This is a L3 slice
      service and using the uniform low-latency slo-sle-template
      policies between all spokes and the hub SDP, but using an explicit
      set of slo policies with a latency metric of 10ms for hub to spoke
      traffic.  There is no peering protocol's configured in this
      example.

B.4.  Example-4: An Any-to-any Slice service with multiple SLOs and DSCP
      Matching

   The following example describes a simplified service configuration of
   an IETF Network slice instance where the SDPs are the customer-facing
   ports on the PE:

      IETF Network Slice 6 on SDP21, SDP23a, and SDP24, with any-to-any
      connectivity type.  This is a L3 slice service and using the
      uniform standard slo-sle-template policies between all SDPs.  For
      traffic matching the dscp of EF, a slo-sle-template policy of low-
      latency will be used.  The slice uses the explicit match approach
      for mapping SDP traffic to a connectivity-construct.

B.5.  Example-5: An any-to-any Network Slice Service with SLO Precedence
      Policies

   The following examples describes a simplified service configuration
   of an IETF Network slice instance 'NS1' with four SDPs: SDP1, SDP2,
   SDP3 and SDP4 with any-to-any connectivity type.  All SDPs are
   designated as customer-facing ports on the PE.

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model          March 2023


   The service is realized using a single any-to-any connectivity
   construct, and a uniform low-bandwidth slo-sle-template policy
   applied to SDP4, SDP3, while a high-bandwidth slo-sle-template policy
   applied to SDP1 and SDP2.

B.6.  Example-6: SDP at CE, L3 any-to-any Slice Service

   The following example describes a simplified service configuration of
   one IETF Network slice instances where the SDPs are located at the
   PE-facing ports on the CE:

   *  IETF Network Slice 7 with SDP31 on CE Device1, SDP33 (with two
      ACs) on Device 3 and SDP34 on Device 4, with an any-to-any
      connectivity type.  This is a L3 slice service and using the
      uniform low-latency slo-sle-template policy between all SDPs.
      These SDPs will also have AC eBGP peering sessions with the
      corresponding PE elements.

   *  This example also introduces the optional attribute of sdp-ip.  In
      this example it could be a loopback on the device.  How this sdp-
      ip is used by the NSC is out-of-scope here, but an example could
      be it is the management interface of the device.

      SDP31 ac-id=ac31, node-id=Device1, interface: GigabitEthernet0
      vlan 100

      SDP33 ac-id=ac33a, node-id=Device3, interface: GigabitEthernet0
      vlan 101

      SDP33 ac-id=ac33b, node-id=Device3, interface: GigabitEthernet1
      vlan 201

      SDP34 ac-id=ac34, node-id=Device4, interface: GigabitEthernet3
      vlan 100

B.7.  Example-7: SDP at CE, L3 any-to-any Slice Service with Network
      abstraction

   The following example describes a simplified service configuration of
   one IETF Network slice instances where the SDPs are located at the
   PE-facing ports on the CE.

   In this example it is assumed that the NSC has either internal
   circuit binding details between the CE and PE already configured or
   has mechanisms to determine this.  The NSC can use various mapping
   mechanisms depending on the capabilities of the NSC including which
   parameters the NSC considers as unique (this mapping is out-of-scope
   of this document) such as using the CE device name, sdp-id, sdp-ip,
   ac-id or the peer-sap-id to complete this circuit binding.

   *  IETF Network Slice 9 with SDP31 on CPE Device1, SDP33 (with two
      ACs) on Device 3 and SDP34 on Device 4, with an any-to-any
      connectivity type.  This is a L3 slice service and using the
      uniform low-latency slo-sle-template policy between all SDPs.
      These SDPs will also have AC eBGP peering sessions with the
      corresponding PE elements.

   *  This example also includes the optional attribute of sdp-ip.  In
      this example it could be a loopback on the device.  How this sdp-
      ip is used by the NSC is out-of-scope here, but an example could
      be it is the management interface of the device.

Appendix D.  Comparison with Other Possible Design choices for IETF
             Network Slice Service Interface

   According to the 5.3.1 IETF Network Slice Service Interface
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], the Network Slice service
   Interface is a technology-agnostic interface, which is used for a
   customer to express requirements for a particular IETF Network Slice.
   Customers operate on abstract IETF Network Slices, with details
   related to their realization hidden.  As classified by [RFC8309], the
   Network Slice service Interface is classified as Customer Service
   Model.

   This draft analyzes the following existing IETF models to identify
   the gap between the IETF Network Slice service Interface
   requirements.

D.1.  ACTN VN Model Augmentation

   The difference between the ACTN VN model and the IETF Network Slice
   service requirements is that the IETF Network Slice service interface
   is a technology-agnostic interface, whereas the VN model is bound to
   the IETF TE Topologies.  The realization of the IETF Network Slice
   does not necessarily require the slice network to support the TE
   technology.

   The ACTN VN (Virtual Network) model introduced
   in[I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang] is the abstract customer view of the
   TE network.  Its YANG structure includes four components:

   *  VN: A Virtual Network (VN) is a network provided by a service
      provider to a customer for use and two types of VN has defined.
      The Type 1 VN can be seen as a set of edge-to-edge abstract links.
      Each link is an abstraction of the underlying network which can
      encompass edge points of the customer's network, access links,
      intra-domain paths, and inter-domain links.

   *  AP: An AP is a logical identifier used to identify the access link
      which is shared between the customer and the IETF scoped Network.

   *  VN-AP: A VN-AP is a logical binding between an AP and a given VN.

   *  VN-member: A VN-member is an abstract edge-to-edge link between
      any two APs or VN-APs.  Each link is formed as an E2E tunnel
      across the underlying networks.

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model          March 2023


   The Type 1 VN can be used to describe IETF Network Slice connection
   requirements.  However, the Network Slice SLO and Network Slice SDP
   are not clearly defined and there's no direct equivalent.  For
   example, the SLO requirement of the VN is defined through the IETF TE
   Topologies YANG model, but the TE Topologies model is related to a
   specific implementation technology.  Also, VN-AP does not define
   "service-match-criteria“ to specify a specific SDP belonging to an
   IETF Network Slice service.

D.2.  RFC8345 Augmentation Model

   The difference between the IETF Network Slice service requirements
   and the IETF basic network model is that the IETF Network Slice
   service requests abstract customer IETF Network Slices, with details
   related to the slice Network hidden.  But the IETF network model is
   used to describe the interconnection details of a Network.  The
   customer service model does not need to provide details on the
   Network.

   For example, IETF Network Topologies YANG data model extension
   introduced in Transport Network Slice YANG Data Model
   [I-D.liu-teas-transport-network-slice-yang] includes three major
   parts:

   *  Network: a transport network list and an list of nodes contained
      in the network

   *  Link: "links" list and "termination points" list describe how
      nodes in a network are connected to each other

   *  Support network: vertical layering relationships between IETF
      Network Slice networks and underlay networks

   Based on this structure, the IETF Network Slice-specific SLO
   attributes nodes are augmented on the Network Topologies model,, e.g.
   isolation etc.  However, this modeling design requires the slice
   network to expose a lot of details of the network, such as the actual
   topology including nodes interconnection and different network layers
   interconnection.
